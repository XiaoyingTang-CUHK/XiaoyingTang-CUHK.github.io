                        <h3>Electric Vehicles</h3>
                        <p>T-lab focuses on addressing charging system optimization challenges in the context of transportation electrification, with the mission to build an intelligent and efficient charging service ecosystem. Through key technological breakthroughs including EV user behavior modeling, scientific charging station siting, dynamic scheduling algorithm optimization, and charging service pricing strategy research, we systematically tackle core challenges arising from transportation electrification: ensuring grid stability under large-scale charging loads, mitigating traffic congestion caused by surging charging demand, and establishing a sustainable development framework that balances charging station profitability with user charging experience.</p>

                        <h3>Federated Learning</h3>
                        <p>Our team has made significant advances in both the theory and application of federated learning. We have developed novel incentive mechanisms and optimization algorithms to balance global and personalized performance, as demonstrated in our representative works published in top journals such as IEEE TNSE and IEEE TII. Our research also addresses key challenges in federated management, load balancing, privacy protection, and communication efficiency, enabling real-world deployment in scenarios like electric vehicle charging and data science. Many of our results have been accepted by leading international journals and conferences (IEEE, ACM, etc.). We welcome students passionate about distributed intelligence and privacy-preserving computation to join us in advancing the frontier of federated learning!</p>

                        <h3>Large Language Models</h3>
                        <p>Our group advances Large Language Models through five flagship studies: DynMoE and TRACE, both accepted to ICLR 2025, deliver cost-adaptive sparse MoE and causal-event long-video grounding respectively. VTG-LLM (AAAI 2025) injects explicit timestamp tokens with slot compression, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot VTG performance. HEM-LLM(arXiv 2024) introduces hierarchical event memory for minute-scale comprehension, while TriSense (arXiv 2025) unifies vision, audio and speech streams for robust multimodal moment detection. With papers accepted by ICLR and AAAI, we welcome passionate students to push the frontier of intelligent systems together.</p>
