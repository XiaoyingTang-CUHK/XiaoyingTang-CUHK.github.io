                        <h3>Intelligent EV Charging Networks</h3>
                        <p>T-lab focuses on addressing charging system optimization challenges in the context of transportation electrification, with the mission to build an intelligent and efficient charging service ecosystem. Through key technological breakthroughs including EV user behavior modeling, scientific charging station siting, dynamic scheduling algorithm optimization, and charging service pricing strategy research, we systematically tackle core challenges arising from transportation electrification: ensuring grid stability under large-scale charging loads, mitigating traffic congestion caused by surging charging demand, and establishing a sustainable development framework that balances charging station profitability with user charging experience.</p>

                        <h3>Federated Learning</h3>
                        <p>Our team has made breakthrough progress in both the theory and application of federated learning. We have tackled key algorithmic challenges in client optimization, fairness guarantee, and privacy protection, including heterogeneous data client clustering, diverse sampling, and federated forgetting, promoting innovative applications of federated learning in cross-domain recommendation and heterogeneous data distribution scenarios. Multiple results have been accepted by top international conferences such as ICML, NeurIPS, AAAI, and leading journals including IEEE TKDE.</p>

                        <h3>Large Language Models</h3>
                        <p>Our group advances Large Language Models through five flagship studies: DynMoE and TRACE, both accepted to ICLR 2025, deliver cost-adaptive sparse MoE and causal-event long-video grounding respectively. VTG-LLM (AAAI 2025) injects explicit timestamp tokens with slot compression, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot VTG performance. HEM-LLM(arXiv 2024) introduces hierarchical event memory for minute-scale comprehension, while TriSense (arXiv 2025) unifies vision, audio and speech streams for robust multimodal moment detection. With papers accepted by ICLR and AAAI, we welcome passionate students to push the frontier of intelligent systems together.</p>
